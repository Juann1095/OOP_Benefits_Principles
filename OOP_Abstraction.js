//-----OOP Principles: Abstraction-----
/* Abstraction is all about writing code in a way that will make it more generalized.
The concepts of encapsulation and abstraction are often misunderstood because their differences can feel blurry.
It helps to think of it in the following terms:
-An abstraction is about extracting the concept of what youÂ´re trying to do, rather than dealing with a specific manifestation of that concept
-Encapsulation is about you not having access to, or not being concerned with, how some implementation works internally.
While both the encapsulation and abstraction are important concepts in OOP, it requires more experience with programming in general to really delve into this tropic.
