//-----OOP Principles: Encapsulation-----
/* In simple terms, encapsulation has to do with marking code implementation "hidden" from other users, in the sense that they don´t know how my code works in order 
to "consume" the code.
For example, running the following code:
*/

"abc".toUpperCase();

/* I don´t really need to worry or even waste time thinking about how the --toUpperCase() method works. All i want is to use it, since i know it´s available to me.
Even if the underlying syntax- that is, the implementation of the --toUpperCase()-- method changes - as long as it doesn´t break my code, i don´t have to worry 
about what it does in the background, or even how it does it.
